# ExchangeRates
This application works with a third-party API (http://www.nbrb.by/APIHelp/ExRates) and converts the Belarusian ruble into various international currencies. The application contains a list of international currencies, a graph of rates of selected currencies for a selected period of time, and also a table of selected exchange rates with the ability to filter out rates by currency name. The widget only works with a chart. It contains dates in the range from today to one year ago. If the date does not fit, the chart of the selected currencies will be plotted on an interval of 30 days. The table and graph are built depending on the selected exchange rates.
